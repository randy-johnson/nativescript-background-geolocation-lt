# Change Log
## [1.6.0] - 2017-04-25
- [Changed] iOS minimum version is now `8.4`.  Plugin will log an error when used on versions of iOS that don't implement the method `CLLocationManager#requestLocation`
- [Fixed] iOS bug executing `#setConfig` multiple times too quickly can crash the plugin when multiple threads attempt to modify an `NSMutableDictionary`
- [Fixed] Android was rounding `battery_level` to 1 decimal place.
- [Fixed] iOS geofences-only mode was not using significant-location-change events to evaluate geofences within proximity.
- [Changed] iOS now uses `CLLocationManager requestLocation` to request the `motionchange` position, rather than counting samples.  This is a more robust way to get a single location
- [Fixed] iOS crash when providing `null` values in `Object` config options (ie: `#extras`, `#params`, `#headers`, etc)
- [Added] New config option `locationsOrderDirection [ASC|DESC]` for controlling the order that locations are selected from the database (and synced to your server).  Defaults to `ASC`.
- [Added] Support for iOS geofence `DWELL` transitions.
- [Changed] Updated **proguard config** to ignore `com.transistorsoft.**` -- `tslocationmanager.aar` is *already* pro-guarded.
- [Fixed] iOS bug when composing geofence data for peristence.  Sometimes it appended a `location.geofence.location` due to a shared `NSDictionary`
- [Fixed] Android issue with applying default settings the first time an app boots.  If you execute `#getState` before `#configure` is called, `#getState` would return an empty `{}`.
- [Changed] The licensing model of Android now enforces license only for **release** builds.  If an invalid license is configured while runningin **debug** mode, a Toast warning will appear **"BackgroundGeolocation is running in evaluation mode."**, but the plugin *will* work.
- [Fixed] iOS bug with HTTP `401` handling.
- [Added] The Android plugin now broadcasts all its events using the Android `BroadcastReceiver` mechanism.  You're free to implement your own native Android handler to receive and react to these events as you wish.

## [1.5.0] - 2017-03-01
- [Changed] Refactor iOS / Android Settings management
- [Fixed] Android sqlite migration issue; when upgrading from very old version -> latest, the "geofences" table migration could be skipped.
- [Fixed] `#emailLog` now works.
- [Added] HTTP JSON template features.  See [HTTP Features](./docs/http.md).  You can now template your entire JSON request data sent to the server by the plugin's HTTP layer.
- [Changed] **ANDROID BREAKING** `license` is no longer provided to `#configure` -- You will now add it to your `app/App_Resources/Android/AndroidManifest.xml` (see [README](README.md) for details):

```diff
<manifest>
  <application>
+    <meta-data android:name="com.transistorsoft.locationmanager.license" android:value="YOUR LICENSE KEY" />
  </application>
</manifest>
```

- [Fixed] Migrate Android `providerchange` mechanism out of the `Service` (which only runs when the plugin is `#start`ed) to a place where it will be monitored all the time, regardless if the plugin is enabled or not.
- [Fixed] Catch `IllegalStateException` reported when using `#getLog`
- [Changed] With new Android "Doze-mode", override "idle" on `stopTimeout` and `schedule` alarms
- [Changed] Tweak iOS accelerometer-only motion-detection system.
- [Fixed] Location-authorization alert being popped up after a `suspend` event because the plugin always attempts to ensure it has a stationary-region here.  Simply check current authorization-status is not == `Denied`.
- [Fixed] iOS Location Authorization alert is shown multiple time.  Also discovered a bug where the `providerchange` `enabled` value was calculated based upon hard-coded `Always` where it should have compared to the configured `locationAuthorizationRequest`.
- [Added] If plugin's `#stop` method is called, the Location Authorization Alert will be hidden (if currently visible).

## [1.4.0]
- [Fixed] Locale issue when rounding location float attributes (eg: `speed`, `heading`, `odometer`)
- [Added] `removeListeners` method for removing all event-listeners.
- [Added] Ability to provide optional arbitrary meta-data `extras` on geofences.
- [Changed] Location parameters `heading`, `accuracy`, `odometer`, `speed`, `altitude`, `altitudeAccuracy` are now fixed at 2 decimal places.
- [Fixed] Bug reported with `EventBus already registered` error.  Found a few cases where `EventBus.isRegistered` was not being used.
- [Added] Android will attempt to auto-sync on heartbeat events.
- [Changed] permission `android.hardware.location.gps" **android:required="false"**` 
- [Added] Implement `IntentFilter` to capture `MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED`, broadcast when user upgrades the app.  If you've configured `startOnBoot: true, stopOnTerminate: false` and optionally `foreceRelaodOnBoot: true`, the plugin will automatically restart when user upgrades the app.
- [Changed] When adding a geofence (either `#addGeofence` or `#addGeofences`), if a geofence already exists with the provided `identifier`, the plugin will first destroy the existing one before creating the new one.
- [Changed] When iOS Scheduler is engaged and a scheduled OFF event occurs, the plugin will continue to monitor significant-changes, since background-fetch events alone cannot be counted on.  This will guarantee the plugin evaluates the schedule each time the device moves ~ 1km.  This will have little impact on power consumption, since these sig.change events will not be persisted or `POST`ed, nor will they even be provided to Javascript.
- [Changed] Android Scheduler will `setExact` Alarm triggers (only works for API `>= KITKAT` or if OEM's OS doesn't override it (ie: Samsung)).
- [Fixed] iOS Scheduler was not listening to `BackgroundFetch` events while plugin was disabled, preventing schedule evaluation from fetch-events (user would have to open the app for scheduler to evaluate).
- [Fixed] Android Use more precise Alarm mechanism for `stopTimeout`
- [Fixed] Improve odometer accuracy.  Introduce `desiredOdometerAccuracy` for setting a threshold of location accuracy for calculating odometer.  Any location having `accuracy > desiredOdometerAccuracy` will not be used for odometer calculation.
- [Fixed] When configured with a schedule, the Schedule parser wasn't ordering the schedule entries by start-time.
- [Fixed] Had a report of null-pointer exception when processing an HTTP error response.  I could not reproduce the issue but find a case where accessing a `String` could produce a NPE.

## [1.3.3] - 2016-12-07
- [Fixed] Bug in `setOdometer` callback.  Add permission check on `setOdometer`Fixes issue #42

## [1.3.2] - 2016-12-05
- [Fixed] `http` event `success` callback receives `{}` but `error` receives `String` (issue #36).
- [Changed] Add ability to set odometer to any arbitrary value.  Before, odometer could only be reset to `0` via `resetOdometer`.  The plugin now uses `setOdometer(Float, successFn, failureFn`.  `resetOdometer` is now just an alias for `setOdometer(0)`.  `setOdometer` will now internally perform a `#getCurrentPosition`, so it can know the exact location where the odometer was set at.  As a result, using `#setOdometer` is exactly like performing a `#getCurrentPosition` and the `success` / `failure` callbacks use the same method-signature, where the `success` callback is provided the `location`.
- [Added] Added ability to create your own arbitrary **background tasks** with new `#startBackgroundTask` method.  Some of the plugin's methods receive a `taskId` which you've had to call `bgGeo.finish(taskId)` upon.  These automatically created `taskId` will soon be removed.  It will be **up to you** to create your own as desired, when you need to perform any long-running task in any of the plugin's callbacks.  `#finish` operates in the same manner as before.

## [1.3.1] - 2016-11-30

## [1.3.0] - 2016-11-23
- [Fixed] `stopWatchPostion` callbacks not being called.
- [Fixed] Bug with Android geofences not posting `event: geofence` and the actual `geofence` data was missing (The data sent to Javascript callback was ok, just the data sent to HTTP.
- [Fixed] Logic bug in `TSGeofenceManager`; was not performing geospatial query when changing state from **MOVING -> STATIONARY**.
- [Added] Geofences-only mode for both iOS and Android **BETA**.  Start geofences-only mode with method `#startGeofences`.
- [Changed] Add some intelligence to iOS motion-detection system:  Use a Timer of `activityRecognitionInterval` seconds before engaging location-services after motion is detected.  This helps to reduce false-positives, particularly when using `preventSuspend` while walking around one's house or office.
- [Changed] Add more intelligence to iOS motion-detection system:  The plugin will be **eager** to engage the stop-detection, as soon as it detects `still`, regardless of confidence.  When the plugin is currently in the **moving** state and detects `still`, it will engage a timer of `activityRecognitionInterval` milliseconds -- when this timer expires and the motion-detector still reports `still`, the stop-detection system will be engaged.  If any *moving* type activity occurs during this time, the timer will be cancelled.
- [Fixed] Bug in Android Scheduler, failing to `startOnBoot`.  Issue #985
- [Added] `#removeListeners` method.  Removes all listeners registered with plugin via `#on` method.
- [Changed] With `preventSuspend: true`, the plugin will no longer immediately engage location-services as soon as it sees a "moving"-type motion-activity:  it will now calculate if the current position is beyond stationary geofence. This helps reduce false-positives engaging location-services while simply walking around one's home or office.
- [Fixed] iOS `batchSync`: When only 1 record in batch, iOS fails to pack the records in a JSON `location: []`, appending to a `location: {}` instead.
- [Fixed] Android was only handling the first geofence event when multiple geofences fire simultaneously.
- [Changed] The plugin will ignore `autoSyncThreshold` when a `motionchange` event occurs.
- [Fixed] Fixed ui-blocking issue when plugin boots with locations in its database with `autoSync: true`.  Found a case where the plugin was executing HTTP Service on the UI thread.
- [Fixed] Return current `state {Object}` in callback to `setConfig`.
- [Fixed] iOS Scheduler puked when provided with a `null` or `[]` schedule.
- [Changed] iOS Scheduler behaviour changed to match Android, where `#stopSchedule` does **not** execute `#stop` on the plugin itself.
- [Fixed] FMDB [has issues](https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb/pull/180) binding array arguments (eg: DELETE FROM locations WHERE id IN(?)).  Solution is to simply compose the query string with concatenation.  Sanitization isn't required here anyway, since the ids come directly from my own query.

## [1.2.5] - 2016-10-31
- [Fixed] Issue compiling demo with `typescript@2.x`
- [Fixed] Remove Android deprecation issues with `AndroidManifest.xml`
- [Changed] Refactor Android scheduler to no use a Service.

## [1.2.4] - 2016-10-27
- [Fixed] Bug in Android `#insertLocation` (Reported in issue #23)
- [Fixed] iOS geofencing issue where multiple geofences trigger simultaneously, only the last geofence event would be transmitted to the client and persisted to database.
- [Added] iOS can now initial-trigger a geofence when device is already within the newly added geofence.  Android has always had this behavour by default.  This behaviour is controlled with new `@config {Integer meters} geofenceInitialTriggerEntry [true]`.
- [Fixed] Android had a bug when Activity terminated with `stopOnTerminate: true`

## [1.2.3] - 2016-10-20
- [Changed] Implement database-logging for Android.  Both iOS and Android now send logs to the database.

## [1.2.2] - 2016-10-16
- [Changed] Remove `nativescript-background-fetch` from dependencies.  Users will have to manually `tns plugin add nativescript-background-fetch`, since `tns plugin add nativescript-background-geolocation-lt` doesn't add `background-fetch` the the root `node_modules` folder.  This fixes the problem referencing background-fetch's .podspec file.

## [1.2.1] - 2016-10-14
- [Changed] Refactor typescript API.  `BackgroundGeolocation` API is all static methods now -- You no longer create an instance of `BackgroundGeolocation`
**OLD**
```Javascript
var bgGeo = new BackgroundGeolocation();
bgGeo.configure(config, callback);

```
**NEW**
```Javascript
BackgroundGeolocation.configure(config, callback);
```

This will make interacting with the plugin throughout your views **much** easier, since views are destroyed when navigated away from.

- [Fixed] `package.json` now references a definitions file.  This should solve issue with error reported in issue #18:
```
JS ERROR Error: Could not find module 'nativescript-background-geolocation-lt'
```

## [1.2.0] - 2016-10-11
- [Changed] Refactor iOS Logging system to use popular CocoaLumberjack library.  iOS logs are now stored in the database!  By default, logs are stored for 3 days, but is configurable with `logMaxDays`.  Logs can now be filtered by logLevel:

| logLevel | Label |
|---|---|
|`0`|`LOG_LEVEL_OFF`|
|`1`|`LOG_LEVEL_ERROR`|
|`2`|`LOG_LEVEL_WARNING`|
|`3`|`LOG_LEVEL_INFO`|
|`4`|`LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG`|
|`5`|`LOG_LEVEL_VERBOSE`|

`#getLog`, `#emailLog` operate in the same manner as before.

- [Fixed] If user declines "Motion Activity" permission, plugin failed to detect this authorization failure and fallback to the accelerometer-based motion-detection system.

- [Changed] Refactored Geolocation system.  The plugin is no longer bound by native platform limits on number of geofences which can be monitored (iOS: 20; Android: 100).  You may now monitor infinite geofences.  The plugin now stores geofences in its SQLite db and performs a geospatial query, activating only those geofences in proximity of the device (@config #geofenceProximityRadius, @event `geofenceschange`).  See the new [Geofencing Guide](./docs/geofencing.md)

## [1.1.1] - 2016-09-25
- [Fixed] Bugs in preventSuspend during background-fetch event

## [1.1.0]
- [Changed] Upgrade to nativescript-2.3.0
- [Fixed] Bug in prevent-suspend where the plugin failed to re-start its prevent-suspend timer if no MotionActivity event occurred during that interval.  Prevent-suspend system should now operate completely independently of MotionDetector.
- [Fixed] `#stop` method wasn't calling `stopMonitoringSignificantChanges`, resulting in location-services icon failing to toggle OFF.
- [Fixed] Issue where iOS crashes when configured with null url.
- [Added] iOS `watchPosition` mechanism.
- [Changed] Refactored iOS motion-detection system.  Improved iOS motion-triggering when using `CMMotionActivityManager` (ie: when not using `disableMotionActivityUpdates: true`).  iOS can now trigger out of stationary-mode just like android, where it sees a 'moving-type' motion-activity (eg: 'on_foot', 'in_vehicle', etc).  Note: this will still occur only when your app isn't suspended (eg: app is in foreground, `preventSuspend: true`, or `#watchPosition` is engaged).
- [Changed] Refactored iOS "prevent suspend" system to be more robust.
- [Fixed] iOS locations sent to Javascript client had a different `uuid` than the one persisted to database (and synced to server).
-[Added] new iOS 10 .plist required key for accelerometer updates `NSMmotionUsageDescription` to `config.xml`.
- [Added] New required android permission `<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.location.gps" />`.
- [Fixed] `removeGeofences` was removing stationary-region.  This would prevent stationary-exit if called while device is in stationary-mode
- [Fixed] Android pukes when it receives an empty schedule `[]`.
- [Fixed] Android when configured with `batchSync: true, autoSync: true` was failing because the plugin automatically tweaked `autoSync: false` but failed to reset it to the configured value.  This behaviour was obsolete and has been removed.
- [Added] Add new config `@param {Integer} autoSyncThreshold [0]`.  Allows you to specify a minimum number of persisted records to trigger an auto-sync action.
- [Fixed] Issue #837.  Android `SimpleDateFormat` used for rendering location timestamp was not being used in a thread-safe manner, resulting in corrupted timestamps for some
- [Fixed] Issue #804, null pointer exeception on mGoogleApiClient
- [Fixed] Issue #806.  PlayServices connect error event was fired before listeners arrive; Dialog to fix problem was never shown.
- [Changed] Removed `app-compat` from Gradle dependencies.
- [Changed] Fire http error callback when HTTP request is not 200ish (ie: 200, 201, 204).  Fixes issue #819.  Contradicts #774.
- [Changed] Remove `play-services:app-compat-v7` from Gradle dependencies
- [Fixed] Android heartbeat location wasn't having its meta-data updated (ie: `event: 'heartbeat', battery:<current-data>, uuid: <new uuid>`)
- [Changed] Reduce Android `minimumActivityRecognitionConfidence` default from `80` to `75` (issue #825)
- [Changed] Android will ask for location-permission when `#configure` is executed, rather than waiting for `#start`.
- [Changeed] Android will catch `java.lang.SecurityException` when attempting to request location-updates without "Location Permission"
