## Installing the plugin ##

#### From npm 
Install the following two plugins:
```bash
$ tns plugin add nativescript-background-geolocation-lt
$ tns plugin add nativescript-background-fetch
```

#### From master (latest, greatest.)

In order to install from Github repo, you must first clone the repo to your local machine and compile the Javascript files (the github repo contains no compiled .js files; they're purposely `.gitignore`d)
```
$ git clone https://github.com/transistorsoft/nativescript-background-geolocation-lt.git
$ cd nativescript-background-geolocation-lt
$ npm install
$ tsc
```

The plugin is compiled and ready to be added to your app:
```
$ tns plugin add /path/to/nativescript-background-geolocation-lt
```

## iOS Setup

Since iOS is more strict with apps running in the background, this plugin requires you install [nativescript-background-fetch](https://github.com/transistorsoft/nativescript-background-fetch) (also created by [Transistor Software](http://transistorsoft.com)).  This plugin automatically awakens a suspended app in the background, providing *exactly* 30s of running-time.  Actually implementing **`background-fetch`** in your application code is **optional** -- `background-geolocation` uses it automatically under-the-hood for its own purposes.  However, you **must** perform the plugin's [setup process](https://github.com/transistorsoft/nativescript-background-fetch#setup) in your **`app.ts`**:

**`app.ts`**
```diff
import * as app from 'application';

+import {BackgroundFetch} from "nativescript-background-fetch";

+if (app.ios) {
+  class MyDelegate extends UIResponder implements UIApplicationDelegate {
+    public static ObjCProtocols = [UIApplicationDelegate];
+      // BackgroundFetch delegate method
+      public applicationPerformFetchWithCompletionHandler(application: any, completionHandler:any) {
+        BackgroundFetch.performFetchWithCompletionHandler(completionHandler);
+      }
+    }
+    app.ios.delegate = MyDelegate;
+}

app.start({ moduleName: 'main-page' });
```

**NOTE** If your build fails with the following errors:
```
app/app.ts(6,28): error TS2304: Cannot find name 'UIResponder'.
app/app.ts(6,51): error TS2304: Cannot find name 'UIApplicationDelegate'.
app/app.ts(7,36): error TS2304: Cannot find name 'UIApplicationDelegate'.
```

This is because your app hasn't loaded the ios platform-declarations.  You can either load those (if you know how ;)) or simply configure your `tsconfig.json` to ignore errors:

```diff
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "module": "commonjs",
        "target": "es5",
        "sourceMap": true,
        "experimentalDecorators": true,
        "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
        "noEmitHelpers": true,
+        "noEmitOnError": false
    },
    "exclude": [
        "node_modules",
        "platforms"
    ]
}
```

## Android Setup (Premium Users)

A [License](http://www.transistorsoft.com/shop/products/nativescript-background-geolocation)) is required to unlock Android.

Edit the file **`app/App_Resources/Android/App_Resources/AndroidManifest.xml`**.  Copy the following `<meta-data />` tag containing your **YOUR LICENSE KEY** within the `<application>` element:

```diff
<manifest>
  <application>
+    <meta-data android:name="com.transistorsoft.locationmanager.license" android:value="YOUR LICENSE KEY" />
  </application>
</manifest>
```

## Demo app

The plugin hosts its own demo app in the `/demo` folder.  Install it like this:
```Bash
$ git clone https://github.com/transistorsoft/nativescript-background-geolocation-lt.git
$ cd nativescript-background-geolocation-lt
$ npm install
$ npm run setup

$ npm run demo.android
or
$ npm run demo.ios
```

Simulating the location with `City Drive` works well:

## Using the plugin

```Javascript
import {BackgroundGeolocation} from "nativescript-background-geolocation-lt";
```

## Example

```Javascript
import {BackgroundGeolocation} from "nativescript-background-geolocation-lt";

export class HelloWorldModel extends observable.Observable {

  private _state: any:

  constructor() {
    super();

    // Listen to events
    BackgroundGeolocation.on("location", this.onLocation.bind(this));
    BackgroundGeolocation.on("motionchange", this.onMotionChange.bind(this));
    BackgroundGeolocation.on("http", this.onHttp.bind(this));
    BackgroundGeolocation.on("heartbeat", this.onHeartbeat.bind(this));
    BackgroundGeolocation.on("schedule", this.onSchedule.bind(this));
    BackgroundGeolocation.on("error", this.onError.bind(this));

    // Configure it.
    BackgroundGeolocation.configure({
      debug: true,
      desiredAccuracy: 0,
      stationaryRadius: 25,
      distanceFilter: 50,
      activityRecognitionInterval: 10000,
      url: 'http://localhost:8080/locations',
      autoSync: true
    }, function(state) {
      // Plugin is ready
      if (!this._state.enabled) {
        BackgroundGeolocation.start();
      }
    }.bind(this));
  }
```

## Help!  It doesn't work!

Yes it does.  [See the Wiki](https://github.com/transistorsoft/nativescript-background-geolocation-lt/wiki)

- on iOS, background tracking won't be engaged until you travel about **2-3 city blocks**, so go for a walk or car-ride (or use the Simulator with ```Debug->Location->City Drive```)
- When in doubt, **nuke everything**:  First delete the app from your device (or simulator)

```
$ tns plugin remove nativescript-background-geolocation-lt
$ tns plugin add nativescript-background-geolocation-lt

```

## Simple Testing Server

A simple Node-based [web-application](https://github.com/transistorsoft/background-geolocation-console) with SQLite database is available for field-testing and performance analysis.  If you're familiar with Node, you can have this server up-and-running in about **one minute**.
